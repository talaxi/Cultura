                <em>This FAQ and game is still a work in progress! Bare with me if certain features aren't fully fleshed out and developed yet. I tend to develop in a way where I will put something out still a bit bare bones and add more to it over time until it is complete. If you have any feedback at all, please let me know using one of the links on the bottom right. Thank you so much for playing and hope you're enjoying it!</em>

                    <p>In the early game, your biggest obstacles will be coins and breed level. Using the Stockbreeder to Auto Breed your animals can give them a big boost in stats. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If you are having a hard time collecting coins, look into buying Team Managers from the Shop and upgrading your barns to Attractions to build passive income. </p>

                    <p>After buying a Team Manager from the shop, you'll have the ability to set a deck as your "Auto Run Free Race" deck. 
                        Once selected, this deck will immediately run free races as soon as the time period resets creating a steady stream of income (assuming you win, of course!).
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    To set a deck as your "Auto Run Free Race" deck, select 'Decks' on the right and then select the button that says "Auto Run Free Race" by the deck you want to select. Note that this option will not be available until you buy a Team Manager.

                        <p>What does upgrading a barn do and how do I specialize my barn?</p>

                    <p>After reaching a certain circuit rank, you will gain the ability to upgrade your barns. Every level you upgrade, you gain a multiplier for a particular stat when training. Hovering over your barn level when selecting a barn will show you your current multipliers. Increasing your barn level can be a great way to get you back in the race after breeding.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>                    
                    At barn level 10, you will instead have the option to specialize. Subsequently, every 10 levels will improve your specialization instead of giving a stat multiplier. The current specialization options are below.<br/><br />
